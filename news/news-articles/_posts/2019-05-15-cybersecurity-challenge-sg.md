To encourage more people to take up cybersecurity as a profession, CSA previously organised two editions of the Cybersecurity Challenge Singapore, a series of challenges and competition designed to inspire and spur cyber enthusiasts to join the industry. The two editions were a success, attracting close to 1500 players for the first stage of the Challenge. This year, CSA will organise the third and final edition of the Challenge. 

To participate in the Challenge, participants must first test their skills on the Singapore floor in CyPhinx. CyPhinx is a virtual skyscraper where players can create avatars, access cybersecurity game challenges and interact with like-minded cybersecurity enthusiasts as well as demonstrate their skills to fellow players and potential employers. The games challenges will focus on cybersecurity disciplines such as incident response, digital forensics and reverse engineering. Players will have their scores captured in the leader board after completing each game.

The top 30 players who emerge from CyPhinx will then be invited to compete in a Face-to-Face (F2F) competition where exciting prizes await the top team and top scoring players. Co-hosted by CSA and BAE Systems, the F2F competition will be held on Wednesday, 2 October 2019 during the Singapore International Cyber Week. Anyone who is a Singaporean or Permanent Resident and currently not working in the cybersecurity field can take part in the Challenge. To enter, register an account with the prefix ’SG’ (e.g. SGJohnTan) and download CyPhinx here. The four games available on the Singapore floor are ‘Spaghetti Junction’, ‘Astute Explorer’, ‘Baroque Coding’ and ‘Hackerloo’. The online qualifying period for the Cybersecurity Challenge SG 2019 will run from now till 14 August 2019.
