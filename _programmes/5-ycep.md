## Programme Description

A key pillar under Singaporeâ€™s Cybersecurity Strategy is the development of a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem comprising a skilled workforce, so that it can support our cybersecurity needs and be a source of new economic growth. To reinforce the future cybersecurity talent pipeline, CSA is moving upstream to engage youths at the pre-tertiary level. 

The YCEP is an exciting four-day cybersecurity programme specially designed to get students excited about their journey towards a cybersecurity career. The inaugural YCEP in 2018, co-organised by CSA and Singapore Polytechnic saw the participation of 97 students from 18 secondary schools. 

YCEP 2019 has now been expanded to involve all polytechnics. Top students with outstanding YCEP scores will get to pit their skills against one another in the inaugural Central Capture-the-Flag (CTF) Competition hosted by CSA on 29 June 2019.

The programme aims to excite students about the possibilities and prospects in the world of cybersecurity, teach them fundamental cybersecurity concepts and give them opportunities to participate in practical assignments and competitions.

Students should join the YCEP because: 

1. There are no prerequisites for participation;

2. The programme rewards competency by providing outstanding students with additional training opportunities; and

3. The programme is a stepping stone for students in their journey to be a cybersecurity professional. It is recognised by polytechnics as evidence of portfolio for their Early Admission 
Exercise.
