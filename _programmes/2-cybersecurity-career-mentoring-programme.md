Cybersecurity is an important growth sector in Singaporeâ€™s economy and digital future. To ensure that we can build the industry sustainably, it is important to deepen our capabilities and promote the growth and career development of cybersecurity professionals.

To attract tertiary students and young professionals who are keen to pursue cybersecurity as a career, CSA partnered the Singapore Computer Society (SCS) to organise the Cybersecurity Career Mentoring Programme.

## Programme Description 

Launched in mid-2017, the Cybersecurity Career Mentoring Programme is a joint initiative by the CSA and SCS, and supported by the Association of Information Security Professionals. The programme aims to provide a platform for students and professionals to receive career guidance and support from experienced cybersecurity mentors and industry experts, through activities such as talks and panel discussions. Participants also have the opportunity to interact closely with the mentors in breakout discussions, developing industry networks and professional connections. Through these activities, participants can gain valuable insights into the industry, helping them to make an informed decision about pursuing a career in cybersecurity.
