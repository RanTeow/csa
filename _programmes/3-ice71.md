ICE71 is the region’s first cybersecurity startup hub. It is a programme that aims to strengthen Singapore’s growing cybersecurity ecosystem by attracting and developing competencies and deep technologies to help mitigate the rapidly increasing cybersecurity risks in the region.

A collaboration between CSA, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Singtel Innov8 and NUS Enterprise, ICE71 will develop and accelerate cybersecurity start-ups from early to late stages, through partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learning, large local enterprises and global cybersecurity accelerators over the next two years. It will do so in three ways – through a pre-accelerator boot-camp, an accelerator training programme, and a landing pad.
